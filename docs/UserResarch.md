## Observation 5: Weston)
Observation Statement:
Top 3 features from survey are Filter by Genre, Filter by Location, and Event / Gig Posting. 
integration with Spotify/Soundcloud and messaging/media sharing are close seconds and filtering by band size could be a negligable addition compared to the other features.

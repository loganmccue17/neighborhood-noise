## Observation 4: (Enmanuel)

Observation Statement: One observation that was made was in the last question "What app format do you think will work best?". 47.2 % of people wanted the app format as list view to view bands in order of distance, and about 30.6 percent wanted a map to view closest bands 

### Supporting Data: 47.2 % - list view , 30.6 - map view , 22.2 - search bar 

Team Action (if any): As a team we planned on formatting our map around the idea of it being like a social media formatted app. This being said we believe we will quickly do the search format first then the list format , and finally the map formatting. This is the order in which we might most likely being our features.
